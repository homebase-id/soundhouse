/**
 * One platform's decode path for poster frames and trim-scrubber filmstrips.
 *
 * Implementations come in two flavours:
 * - "Primary" decoders use the OS-native pipeline (MediaCodec / AVFoundation /
 *   `<video>`+`<canvas>`). Hardware-accelerated and ships with the OS.
 * - "Fallback" decoders use ffmpeg (FFmpegKit on iOS, ffmpeg.wasm on web,
 *   ffmpeg subprocess on JVM). Heavier, broader codec coverage.
 *
 * [TieredVideoDecoder] composes a primary and an optional fallback into a single
 * [VideoDecoder] that runs the fallback only when the primary fails or produces
 * a partial result. Each platform's `platformVideoDecoder()` factory assembles the
 * right combination — see [VideoThumbnailService].
 *
 * The [videoPath] string is platform-specific by necessity (see the KDoc on
 * [VideoThumbnailService]); it stays a `String` to mesh with the rest of the
 * `FFmpegUtils` video pipeline.

     * Extract [frameCount] thumbnails evenly spaced across `[0, durationMs]`. Frames are
     * emitted onto the returned [Flow] as they become ready (out-of-order is allowed), and
     * each frame is decoded at the closest sync (keyframe) to its target time, scaled to
     * approximately [targetHeightPx] tall (preserving aspect ratio), and JPEG-encoded.
     *
     * **Emission timing varies by backend.** Native primary decoders
     * ([AvFoundationVideoDecoder] on iOS, [BrowserVideoDecoder] on Web,
     * `MediaCodec` on Android) emit frames as the hardware produces them, and the ffmpeg
     * backends on JVM and iOS poll their output dir during the ffmpeg run, so the trim
     * scrubber fills progressively. The ffmpeg.wasm backend on web resolves a single
     * Promise at end-of-run and then bulk-emits — Promise-driven, no mid-run polling
     * hook. Don't depend on every emission landing on a separate scheduler tick.
     *
     * @param skipMask Optional snapshot of which indices an earlier tier already produced.
     *   When non-null, `skipMask[i] == true` means the runner already has frame `i` and the
     *   implementation MAY skip its decode. Honoring this is an optimization, not a contract
     *   — implementations are free to ignore the mask and decode all N (the [TieredVideoDecoder]
     *   drops dupes either way). Only [MmrVideoDecoder] honors it today; the ffmpeg-backed
     *   decoders run a single bulk invocation per call (one fps-filter `-frames:v N`) and
     *   ignore the mask. Always `null` when called from the production [VideoThumbnailService]
     *   entry point — populated only by [TieredVideoDecoder] when handing work to a fallback.
