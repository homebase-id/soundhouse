/**
 * One greppable tag for the app's background-observability baseline (#1109). All lines share the
 * `BgTrace` Kermit tag so a day's `homebase.log` yields a clean background breakdown from a single
 * `grep BgTrace` — instead of hand-correlating scattered `LiveRelay` / GPS-profile / WS logs.
 *
 * Line shapes are built by the pure formatter functions below so they can be unit-tested and stay
 * stable for downstream log tooling. This is log-only; nothing here changes behavior.
 *
 * Categories emitted today:
 * - `transition …`  — foreground↔background flip with the duration of the window just ended.
 * - `ws-connect …`  — a notify-WS connect attempt, tagged with foreground/background state. A
 *                     `state=bg` attempt is the red flag #1108 targets (a background reconnect with
 *                     no reason to be connected).
 * - `wake cause=…`  — why the process was active in the background (fcm / location-delivery /
 *                     ws-recv / live-share-send).
 *
 * Deferred to companion issues (documented so the format stays consistent when they land):
 * - `ip-target …`   — stored-ip vs dns connect-target decision → lands with #1107 (the code that
 *                     makes the choice).
