 * Transport-level failure reaching the server — connect/socket/request timeout,

 * [OdinApiException]'s HTTP-status subclasses ([NotFoundException], … ), which
 * mean the server *did* respond. [status] is `0` to signal "no HTTP response".
 *
 * The raw Ktor/transport exception is preserved as [cause] so a crash report or
 * log carries the real stack. Produced centrally by [OdinApiProviderBase.request]
 * / [OdinApiProviderBase.requestBytes] so every REST call surfaces connectivity
 * failures as one catchable, typed exception instead of a raw `IOException`.
