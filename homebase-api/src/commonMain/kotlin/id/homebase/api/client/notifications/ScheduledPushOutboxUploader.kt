/**
 * Outbox uploader for **scheduled push notifications** — the shim that lets a schedule/cancel
 * survive an offline RSVP by riding the existing durable outbox queue + retry/backoff + drain-on-
 * reconnect, instead of being a fire-once HTTP call at tap time.
 *
 * Dispatched by [CompositeOutboxUploader] for [SchedulePush] / [CancelPush]; all drive uploadTypes
 * still go to `DriveOutboxUploader`.
 *
 * ## Everything keys off `tagId`, not a device-local jobId
 * The server returns only a jobId, which is useless to the user's *other* devices. But a
 * client-chosen `tagId` (here: the event `messageId`) is passed through verbatim into every
 * `list()` entry's `options.tagId`, and job listing is scoped per-app (all the user's devices see
 * the same jobs). So both schedule and cancel reconcile against `list()` filtered by `tagId`, which
 * is identical on every device — Device B's un-RSVP cancels the job Device A scheduled.
 *
 * ## Sharp edges (intentional, for the "should we properly adjust the outbox / server" discussion)
 *
 * 1. **No server upsert / idempotency key.** `schedule()` unconditionally creates a job; there is no
 *    dedup server-side. We reconcile client-side ([decideScheduleAction] + [duplicateJobsToPrune]
 *    over `list()`), which closes the retry, single-device re-RSVP, and common cross-device cases,
 *    and now collapses any accumulated duplicates back to one on the next schedule. It still does
 *    NOT close a genuine concurrent schedule where two racers both `list()` before either creates
 *    (a two-device tap at the same instant, OR — single device — a cancel enqueued while a schedule
 *    for the same tag is already checked out and mid-POST, so the cancel's `list()` runs before the
 *    schedule's job is visible → cancel no-ops, schedule creates a job that outlives the
 *    retraction). Both leave a stray job that the next cancel-by-tag (or a re-affirmed Going's
 *    prune) removes. Duplicates also count against the server's `MaxPendingPerTenant = 100` cap. A
 *    server-side unique key (client-supplied, upsert-on-conflict) would remove the race and the
 *    extra `list()` round trip entirely; that's the ask on the table.
 *
 * 2. **An extra `list()` per schedule/cancel.** The reconcile costs one round trip each. Fine for a
 *    low-frequency RSVP action; would disappear with server-side upsert + a cancel-by-tag endpoint.
 *
 * 3. **Non-drive rows keep the outbox non-idle.** A long-queued (offline) reminder row keeps the
 *    outbox `count() != 0`, deferring the idle orphan-temp reap. Harmless (no payload temps).
