/**
 * Decides what to delete from the app cache directory.
 *
 * Two entry points:
 * - [sweepUntracked] — startup reclaim: deletes our own entries except the
 *   tracked Coil DiskCache directories. Eats the cache backlog (FFmpeg scratch,
 *   share temps, leftover pickers, ...).
 * - [sweepAll] — logout reclaim: also deletes the tracked caches.
 *
 * Anything that isn't ours ([CacheAudit.Entry.foreign]: loose files, other directories) is always kept —
 * see [decide] and [CacheAudit.isOwnedDirectory].
 *
 * Special case: if `coil3_disk_cache` is found it is logged at **ERROR** and
 * deleted — its mere existence means something bypassed our configured
 * ImageLoader. This absorbs the role previously scattered across `AppModule`'s
 * logout lambda, the Storage screen's "Clear caches" button, and
 * `probeOrphanCoilDiskCache`.
 *
 * The shape of the sweep was validated in dry-run mode against an on-device
 * cache audit before this real-delete flip; see commit history.
