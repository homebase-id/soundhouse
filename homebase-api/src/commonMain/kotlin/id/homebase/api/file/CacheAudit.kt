/**
 * Read-only inventory of the app cache directory
 * ([FileOperationsProvider.getCacheDirectory]).
 *
 * Motivation: Android's system "Cache" figure — which is exactly
 * `context.cacheDir` — was observed at ~4 GB while the app's Storage Settings
 * screen accounted for only ~710 MB. The gap is scratch files written straight
 * into the cache directory that the app neither tracks, caps, nor evicts:
 * FFmpeg segment/compress output, `hls_*` dirs created on every video send,
 * decrypted downloads, share temp files, the legacy `hbvid_preload` dir, and so
 * on. [CacheAudit] enumerates the *top-level* entries of the cache directory and
 * classifies each as "known" (one of the four capped Coil `DiskCache`
 * directories) or "untracked", so the breakdown is visible both in logs and in
 * the Storage Settings UI.
 *
 * This is diagnostics only — it never deletes anything.

     *   ([writeBytesToOutboxTempFile]), each referenced by an outbox row until the send completes
     *   (a long time when offline). Durable: the CacheSweeper KEEPs it on the startup / "Clear
     *   caches" sweep so an in-flight upload's payload is never deleted mid-flight, and only wipes
     *   it on full logout. It's reaped along the outbox's own lifecycle — on success
     *   (cleanupPayloadTempFiles) and on drop after ~48h (cleanupPayloadsForDroppedRow).
