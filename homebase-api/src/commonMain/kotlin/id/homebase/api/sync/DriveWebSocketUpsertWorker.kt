/**
 * Receives decrypted [HomebaseFile] headers shipped on the WebSocket
 * push channel and writes them straight to [DriveMainIndex] without
 * going through HTTP `Drive.sync()`.
 *
 * One worker instance per drive. [OdinWebSocketClient] keeps a map
 * of these and lazily creates entries on the first file event for
 * each drive.
 *
 * Mirrors [DriveSync]'s job-serialization pattern (kept deliberately
 * close so the two paths are easy to reason about side by side):
 *  - [Mutex.tryLock] gives single-flight semantics — only one drain
 *    runs at a time per worker.
 *  - An atomic killroy bit captures "another file came in while we
 *    were busy"; the `finally` block re-launches a drain if it's set,
 *    exactly like [DriveSync.sync].
 *  - Pending files accumulate in a small queue while a drain runs;
 *    the next drain picks them up as one batch.
 *
 * Why batch: a peer sending several files back-to-back produces
 * several WS notifications in tight succession. Funnelling them into
 * one [MainIndexMetaHelpers.HomebaseFileProcessor.baseUpsertEntryZapZap]
 * call collapses N transactions into one — much faster, and matches
 * the shape that DriveSync produces for its own batches.
 *
 * The WS path does NOT advance a sync cursor — that's [DriveSync]'s
 * job. The per-reconnect catch-up via
 * `AuthConnectionCoordinator.onConnected → driveSyncManager.syncAll()`
 * is the backstop for anything missed during a transient disconnect.
