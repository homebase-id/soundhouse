 *   value means scheduling pressure, not a slow query.
 * - [sqlMs] — total wall-clock spent inside `driver.executeQuery` (raw-SQL path) or
 *   the SQLDelight `executeAs*` block (typed-query path). This is "SQL + mapper",
 *   not "SQL alone".
 * - [mapperMs] — for the raw-SQL path, the subset of [sqlMs] spent on mapper CPU
 *   *between* `SqlCursor.next()` calls (field gets, object construction, JSON
 *   deserialization). The "real SQL" portion is therefore `sqlMs - mapperMs`.
 *   Zero for the typed-query path ([readValue]) because we don't instrument the
 *   SQLDelight-generated mapper there (its mapper is a thin code-gen constructor,
 *   not a JSON deserialization, so the split would be noise).
 *
 * Surfaced via [DatabaseManager.lastReadTiming] — but note this is a SINGLE shared cell
 * overwritten by every read, so it is only reliable when you control concurrency (e.g. the
 * read-lane unit test). Do NOT read it after the fact to attribute timing to a specific
 * query from arbitrary code — a concurrent read on another coroutine will have clobbered it
 * (this caused garbled `queueWait` in `SlowMessageFetch`). For accurate per-query timing,
 * use the `SlowDbRead` log line that [executeReadQuery]/[readValue] emit for that exact read.

     * SlowDbRead warn; [label] names the read in the log since there's no SQL string.
     *
     * **No `sql=` / `mapper=` split here** (unlike [executeReadQuery]). The mapper that
     * runs inside `executeAsList` is owned by SQLDelight code-gen — typically a thin
     * `(col1, col2, …) -> Row(col1, col2, …)` — so the legacy single-timer reading is
     * accurate enough for the typed-query path. The split exists for [executeReadQuery]
     * because QueryBatch's mapper does row-level JSON deserialization that can dwarf the
     * SQL itself; SQLDelight rows don't have that hazard.
     *
     * Keep [block] to the DB read itself (executeAsList / executeAsOneOrNull) and do any
     * mapping/deserialization outside, so a read-lane slot is held only for the SQL — not
     * for CPU-bound row mapping.
