/**
 * Cross-device registry of optional drives (feed, vault, …) that this identity has
 * activated.
 *
 * **Storage model.** A single file on the user's Chat drive:
 * - `driveId = SystemDriveConstants.chatDrive.alias`
 * - `fileType = RegistryDriveFileType` (4242)
 * - `uniqueId = REGISTRY_UNIQUE_ID` (a fixed well-known constant, one file per identity)
 * - `appData.content = OdinSystemSerializer.serialize(List<LabeledDrive>)`
 *
 * Add/remove mutate the list and write back the whole file via
 * `updateFileByUniqueId` with the current `versionTag` — the file itself is never
 * deleted. Concurrent edits from two devices land as `VersionTagMismatch`; the
 * loser re-fetches and retries, merging its delta into the winner's list.
 *
 * **Why a single list file instead of one file per drive.** The Homebase sync
 * engine propagates UPDATES to files via `BatchReceived`, but a hard-deleted file
 * simply vanishes on the server — other devices never see a tombstone. A per-drive
 * design means "unmount" doesn't propagate. Treating the registry as a single file
 * whose content mutates sidesteps that: every add/remove is a content update, and
 * updates propagate the same way a chat message does.
 *
 * **Reads are offline-safe.** [loadDrives] queries the local SQLDelight index, which
 * the Chat-drive sync pipeline populates decrypted (see
 * `ServerFile.decryptAppData`). No HTTP.
 *
 * **Cross-device propagation.** [start] launches an observer on the [EventBus] that
 * diffs the local index against an in-memory set whenever a Chat-drive batch
 * carrying the registry file arrives. Newly-appearing drives trigger [onMount];
 * disappearing ones trigger [onUnmount].
 *
 * Mandatory drives (chat, contacts, profile) are hardcoded in `mandatorySyncDrives`
 * and are never stored here. See `ADDING_ADDON_APPS.md §"Mandatory vs Optional Drives"`.

     * round-trip. Once the in-flight call completes the deferred is cleared, so a
