/**
 * The single primitive for an optional add-on drive's activation lifecycle (Vault, Moments,
 * Location, Stickers). Centralizes the two operations every add-on otherwise hand-rolls:
 *
 *  - **read** "is this app activated" = the drive is currently mounted, and
 *  - **write** "activate this app" = register (persist to [DriveRegistry]) + mount.
 *
 * There are two kinds of caller:
 *
 *  - **Pre-mounted drives** — mandatory drives (Chat, Contacts) are always mounted, and an
 *    optional drive activated in a previous session is mounted at login by
 *    [AuthConnectionCoordinator]'s registry pre-mount loop. For these, activation is a pure
 *    read: [isActivated] returns true and nothing needs mounting.
 *  - **Enable-on-demand drives** — an optional app the user has not activated yet calls
 *    [activate] exactly once, when the user enables the feature. From then on it is a
 *    pre-mounted drive on every subsequent start.
 *
 * This helper owns ONLY the drive primitive. It does not decide *when* to activate, nor own
 * onboarding, permissions, content creation, or preferences (icon visibility, view mode,
 * tracking toggles) — those remain per-app.
