/**
 * Marker for state that belongs to ONE logged-in identity and must not outlive it.
 *
 * Implementing this is a claim about lifetime, not behaviour: it says "when the user logs
 * out, I am garbage". The guard test asserts that nothing marked this way is registered as
 * an app-lifetime `single`, which is what keeps the rule from decaying into a checklist
 * somebody has to remember to update.
 *
 * Conversation, drive, contact, feed, moment, location, vault, sticker and email state is
 * identity-scoped. Platform plumbing that legitimately outlives a session — the database
 * manager, the HTTP client factory, [org.koin.core.Koin] itself, and CredentialsManager,
 * which is the thing that *clears* credentials — is not.

 * instead of reusing reset ones. That is the whole point: forgetting to clear something
 * becomes impossible, because nothing survives to be stale.
 *
 * Replaces three overlapping mechanisms that each covered part of the surface — a
 * hand-maintained `reset()` list in AppModule (which ran at the *next* login, not at
 * logout, and skipped entirely on a warm relaunch), ad-hoc self-clearing on
 * `BackendEvent.SessionEnded`, and, for anything nobody remembered, nothing at all.
