/**
 * Why an on-demand GPS request needs [requestLatestGps] (and a reason). The continuous tracker only
 * arms *interval* updates on foreground; a brief app-open closes before the first interval fires, so
 * a backgrounded moving session (e.g. sailing) records almost nothing (#878 root cause A). The fix is
 * to force a one-shot fix on app-open / push-receipt when the last point is stale. To keep that from
 * draining the battery when triggers cluster, every on-demand path funnels through ONE idempotent,
 * battery-aware primitive instead of calling the one-shot provider directly.

/**
 * The single public entry point for "this device's location", callable from anywhere in the app. It
 * composes the three otherwise-separate concerns so callers don't reach into them individually:
 *  - **acquire** ([LocationTrackingCoordinator]) — owns the GPS hardware on/off/mode,
 *  - **route** ([LocationFixRouter]) — a captured fix → persist (history) and/or relay (live),
 *  - **access** ([LocationPointStore] + permission) — last-known position, one-shot fix.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT contain the routing policy — it exposes it. The persist-vs-relay decision
 * stays in [LocationFixRouter] (#835).
 *
 * **[requestLatestGps] is the one on-demand capture path** — so the battery + timing policy lives in
 * one place (#878). Automatic triggers (app-open, push, future activity transitions) MUST go through
 * the gated [forceCaptureIfTracking] (which delegates here); only interactive/transient consumers
 * (the live map) call [requestLatestGps] directly. Either way every fix flows through here:
 *  - **single-flight:** concurrent/duplicate calls coalesce onto the in-flight acquisition,
 *  - **battery-aware:** a min interval between real acquisitions + reuse of a recent last-known,
 *  - **timing-aware:** foreground reasons wait longer at high accuracy; background reasons use a short
 *    timeout and fall back fast to last-known.

     * the last-known dot and is persisted (if history is on) and/or relayed (if a share is live).
     * Because every [GpsRequestReason.staleAfterMs] is larger than the store's 20 s stationary-noise
