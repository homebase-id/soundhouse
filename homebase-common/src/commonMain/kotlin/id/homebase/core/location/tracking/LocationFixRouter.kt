/**
 * THE single home of the "what does a captured GPS fix do?" decision (issue #835). Every capture
 * path — the continuous platform tracker, the Android background `LocationUpdatesReceiver`, and the
 * one-shot `getCurrentGps` (via `LocationService`) — submits here, so the persist-vs-relay routing
 * is greppable in one place instead of smeared across the store, the share service, and DI wiring.
 *
 * The routing tree, for each accepted (deduped) fix:
 *  1. **Always** publish it as the latest-known position ([LocationPointStore.publishLastKnown]) —
 *     feeds the live map's "you" dot and `getCurrentGps`, even with history off and no share.
 *  2. **Persist as history iff** [allowHistory] — the only flag this class reads (bug #823: a live
 *     share holds GPS on with history off, but those fixes must NOT be recorded as history).
 *  3. **Hand every fix to the live-share service** ([relayLatest]); it self-gates — relays to live
 *     recipients under its throttle, prunes expired roster entries, and drops the coordinator's GPS
 *     hold when the last share ends. The roster check stays encapsulated there (its own state), so
 *     this class doesn't duplicate it.
 *
 * Dedup (out-of-order + stationary-noise) is delegated to [LocationPointStore.dedup]; this class owns
 * only the routing. It is the [LocationPointSink] the platform trackers are created with.
