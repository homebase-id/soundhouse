/**
 * Platform hook for a UI-thread liveness check that runs on a dedicated OS thread rather than
 * a coroutine dispatcher — see [MainThreadWatchdog]'s doc for why the coroutine-based loop alone
 * can't detect a stall caused by [kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers.Default]'s own pool being
 * exhausted (that pool starving takes the watchdog's own loop down with it).
 *
 * Registered by androidMain/jvmMain (a raw `Thread` posting to the real UI thread). Platforms
 * without a registered [Probe] (iOS, wasmJs) make [startIfAvailable] a no-op; those platforms
 * rely solely on [MainThreadWatchdog]'s coroutine-based wall-clock-gap detection, which is
 * dispatcher-agnostic.
