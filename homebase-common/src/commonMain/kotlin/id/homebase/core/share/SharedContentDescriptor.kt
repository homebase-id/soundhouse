 * a blank [text] shadows the [url] (iOS vends an empty `public.plain-text` next to
 * the real link for some hosts, e.g. Google Maps) and sends an empty message; a
 * non-blank [text] shadows it and sends the caption without the link. So blank is
 * treated as absent, and a caption is carried *alongside* its link rather than
 * instead of it — unless the caption already contains the link, which is the common
 * case and must not be duplicated.
