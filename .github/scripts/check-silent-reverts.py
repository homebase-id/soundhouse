"""
Flag PR-removed code that was added by another commit on the base branch
within the lookback window — i.e. silent reverts of recently-merged work.

Background
----------
Stash-pop / merge / rebase resolutions on a long-lived branch can silently
re-delete lines that landed on main while the branch was sleeping. PR review
catches this poorly because GitHub collapses big-file diffs by default and
the regressed hunks read like cosmetic refactors at a glance. chat-kmp PR #478
(dice-battle merge) silently undid five recently-landed fixes from PRs
#472/#473/#474/c0f0cb23 this way.

Algorithm
---------
1. Diff the PR's head against the merge-base with the target branch.
2. Extract each *contiguous* block of removed lines that's at least
   MIN_BLOCK_SIZE non-blank, non-trivial lines long.
3. Walk every non-merge commit on the target branch within the LOOKBACK_DAYS
   window. For each commit, extract its added blocks for files the PR
   removed lines from.
4. If a PR-removed block matches an added block from a recent commit (>= 70%
   line overlap), flag it.

Output
------
Writes a human-readable report to stdout AND to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY (if
set). Exits 0 regardless of findings — this is informational so reviewers
can verify, not a hard gate. False-positive cost would be high otherwise:
some PRs legitimately revert recent commits.

Env
---
BASE_REF        target-branch ref to compare against.   default: origin/main
HEAD_REF        PR head ref.                            default: HEAD
LOOKBACK_DAYS   how far back to look for "recent" commits on BASE_REF.
                                                        default: 30
MIN_BLOCK_SIZE  smallest contiguous removed block (in non-blank lines) the
                check considers — filters out coincidental "}" matches.
                                                        default: 3
MIN_OVERLAP     fraction of removed-block lines that must also appear in the
                recent commit's added block.            default: 0.7
